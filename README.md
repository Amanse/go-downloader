## Go-downloader
A very basic downloader for fuckingfast[dot]co

### Usage
```bash
go-downloader --file links.txt
```
You do not URLs you get after going to site and clicking the button, it will auto-resolve that, you can directly links that you get from _you know where_.
It lets golang handle the multi threading part by launching the downloads in go funcs all together.
